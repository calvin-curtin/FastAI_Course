    "## Ensembling\n",
    "Think back to the original reasoning behind why random forests work so well: each tree has errors, but those errors are not correlated with each other, so the average of those errors should tend towards zero once there are enough trees. Similar reasoning could be used to consider averaging the predictions of models trained using different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have two very different models, trained using very different algorithms: a random forest, and a neural network. It would be reasonable to expect that the kinds of errors that each one makes would be quite different. Therefore, we might expect that the average of their predictions would be better than either one's individual predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, a random forest is itself an ensemble. But we can then include a random forest in *another* ensembleâ€”an ensemble of the random forest and the neural network! While ensembling won't make the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful modeling process, it can certainly add a nice little boost to any models that you have built.\n",
    "\n",
    "One minor issue we have to be aware of is that our PyTorch model and our sklearn model create data of different types: PyTorch gives us a rank-2 tensor (i.e, a column matrix), whereas NumPy gives us a rank-1 array (a vector). `squeeze` removes any unit axes from a tensor, and `to_np` converts it into a NumPy array:\n"

    "## Boosting\n",
    "So far our approach to ensembling has been to use *bagging*, which involves combining many models (each trained on a different data subset) together by averaging them. As we saw, when this is applied to decision trees, this is called a *random forest*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another important approach to ensembling, called *boosting*, where we add models instead of averaging them. Here is how boosting works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a small model that underfits your dataset.\n",
    "- Calculate the predictions in the training set for this model.\n",
    "- Subtract the predictions from the targets; these are called the \"residuals\" and represent the error for each point in the training set.\n",
    "- Go back to step 1, but instead of using the original targets, use the residuals as the targets for the training.\n",
    "- Continue doing this until you reach some stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of trees, or you observe your validation set error getting worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach, each new tree will be attempting to fit the error of all of the previous trees combined. Because we are continually creating new residuals, by subtracting the predictions of each new tree from the residuals from the previous tree, the residuals will get smaller and smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions with an ensemble of boosted trees, we calculate the predictions from each tree, and then add them all together. There are many models following this basic approach, and many names for the same models. *Gradient boosting machines* (GBMs) and *gradient boosted decision trees* (GBDTs) are the terms you're most likely to come across, or you may see the names of specific libraries implementing these; at the time of writing, *XGBoost* is the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, unlike with random forests, with this approach there is nothing to stop us from overfitting. Using more trees in a random forest does not lead to overfitting, because each tree is independent of the others. But in a boosted ensemble, the more trees you have, the better the training error becomes, and eventually you will see overfitting on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to go into detail on how to train a gradient boosted tree ensemble here, because the field is moving rapidly, and any guidance we give will almost certainly be outdated by the time you read this. As we write this, sklearn has just added a `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` class that provides excellent performance. There are many hyperparameters to tweak for this class, and for all gradient boosted tree methods we have seen. Unlike random forests, gradient boosted trees are extremely sensitive to the choices of these hyperparameters; in practice, most people use a loop that tries a range of different hyperparameters to find the ones that work best.\n"

    "## Combining Embeddings with Other Methods\n",
    "The abstract of the entity embedding paper we mentioned at the start of this chapter states: \"the embeddings obtained from the trained neural network boost the performance of all tested machine learning methods considerably when used as the input features instead\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are dramatically improved by using the embeddings instead of the raw categories. This is a really important result, because it shows that you can get much of the performance improvement of a neural network without actually having to use a neural network at inference time. You could just use an embedding, which is literally just an array lookup, along with a small decision tree ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "These embeddings need not even be necessarily learned separately for each model or task in an organization. Instead, once a set of embeddings are learned for some column for some task, they could be stored in a central place, and reused across multiple models. In fact, we know from private communication with other practitioners at large companies that this is already happening in many places."
